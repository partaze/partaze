### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cheryl Vadivello an IT enthusiast. I love programming and it is my goal to learn as many programming languages as possible. I am currently seeking employment in the IT sector. I know my stuff, and if I don't well I can learn...really quickly. I don't have a piece of paper as of yet to vouch for me, henceforth I will be uploading projects as soon as they are ready. Hopefully someone will notice and give me a shot.
